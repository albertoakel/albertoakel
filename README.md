Introductions can be a bit challenging, but here we go. My name is Alberto Akel, and depending on how you know me, I might wear different hats. If you're here, you're probably not part of my running group or photography club. Academically, I am a geophysicist with a master's degree in geophysics and a doctorate in electrical engineering. Most of my career has been dedicated to science, mathematics, physics, and enough programming to support my activities. In recent years, I have focused on undergraduate teaching and scientific communication. I am currently exploring new professional opportunities in the field of data science.

**highlights**
- 🌱 My first programming language was Fortran.
- 🐧 I prefer working in a Linux environment rather than Windows;
- 🏃 I'm a marathon runner and often wake up at 4:20 a.m
- 🪚 I designed part of the furniture in my house;
- 💬 Ask me anythink about science. I talk a lot!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
