Introductions are always a bit difficult, but okay. My name is Alberto Akel and depending on where you know me, I am something. If you are here, you are probably not part of my running group, or the photography club. Academically, I am a geophysicist, with a master's degree in geophysics and a doctorate in electrical engineering. I have worked most of my life with science, mathematics, physics and enough programming for my activities. In recent years, I have dedicated myself to teaching at the undergraduate level and to scientific communication. I am currently seeking new professional opportunities in the field of data science.
