Introductions can be a bit challenging, but here we go. My name is Alberto Akel, and depending on how you know me, I might wear different hats. If you're here, you are probably not part of my running group or the photography club. Academically, I am a geophysicist with a master's degree in geophysics and a doctorate in electrical engineering. Most of my career has been dedicated to science, mathematics, physics, and enough programming to support my activities. In recent years, I have focused on undergraduate teaching and scientific communication. I am currently seeking new professional opportunities in the field of data science
